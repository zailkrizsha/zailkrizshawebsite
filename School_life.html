        <h2>Zail Krizsha Barrientos Samulde</h2>
        <p> I started my first year of school at Malabor Baptis Christian Academy attending my ABC's class also known as kindergarten. during my first year of developement i made friends and learned new stuff. such as the abcs, sign language,reading,writing and the bible. I then attended first grade at Malabor elementary school because i begged my mom to let me join extra curricular activities ther. In just one school year I joined as much activities i could. At a young age of 6 i made my name in that school as i achieved multiple achievements repesenting my school. I also joined the student goverment council and i was always on the top of my class. Until now my old teachers recognize me as the school's asset. in second grade i moved back to MBCA and continued my achievments there completing my second grade year being on the principal's honor roll and other more achievments. in 3rd grade we moved to iloilo and studied at tiwi elementary school. life there was hard because we were bullied and our parents were away. after christmast break in 3rd grade we transfered in Banusing Serdena Elementary School and i graduated there as the valedictorian. I am currently studying at Antique National School under Special Program in the arts majoring in Creative Writing. </p>

<p> School life has been a mix of excitement, stress, and some pretty unforgettable moments. The day-to-day routine—getting up early, rushing to get everything ready, and the usual scramble to not be late—was a constant. But once I settled into class, there was always something to look forward to, whether it was a new lesson or a fun project. Some subjects were a breeze, while others had me pulling my hair out, especially when exams were coming up.

One thing I really enjoyed was hanging out with friends. The breaks between classes were always filled with laughs and random conversations that somehow made the day better. We’d joke around, talk about the latest trends, or just vent about how hard everything was. It was during those moments that school didn’t feel so much like “work” and more like a place where we could just be ourselves.

But there were definitely tough times too. The pressure to do well in exams, the stress of assignments piling up, and the occasional feeling of not being able to keep up with everything—it wasn’t always easy. There were days when I’d feel overwhelmed, but in the end, it was all part of the experience. And when I made it through, I felt a sense of pride in how I handled it.

Looking back, though, it’s the little things that stand out: the surprise quizzes, last-minute study sessions with friends, and those moments when everything just clicked. Even though school life had its ups and downs, I’d say it shaped me in ways I didn’t fully realize at the time.</P>
