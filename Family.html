        <h2>Zail Krizsha Barrientos Samulde</h2>
        <p> I come from a family of four. My dad is Raymond P. Samulde. My mother is Chenee Joy B. Samulde. I have a a younger brother who is also in Spa9 and he is Jan Rayd B. Samulde. We are also expecting another addition to our family. We like to do movie nights as our family bonding and we discuss a lot of stuff on the dinner table. My mom is an ICT teacher and my dad is an IT technician. </p>
<p> My family means the world to me. It's me, my mom, my dad, and my younger brother, and there's always something happening at home. My little brother is a ball of energy, and even though he can be a handful sometimes, he is indeed a handful...
Right now, things are about to get even more interesting because we’ve got another baby on the way! I’m really excited, but also a little nervous about how things will change. It’s going to be a huge adjustment, especially with a newborn in the house, but I know it’s going to bring a lot of joy and new memories. My parents are so happy, and I can see how much they’re looking forward to it. Even though we have our moments of chaos, I think adding a new member to the family will make everything feel even more complete.

My mom and dad are super supportive. They’ve always been there for me, no matter what, and they really believe in me, especially as I switched from dance to creative writing. They’ve always encouraged me to pursue what makes me happy, and their support means everything to me. I know the road ahead won’t always be easy, but with them by my side, I feel ready for whatever comes our way.

All in all, even though life can get hectic, I wouldn’t change a thing. My family is my backbone, and through all the changes, I know we’ll always stick together.

</P>
