        <h2>Zail Krizsha Barrientos Samulde</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Zail Krizsha Barrientos Samulde, and I was born on January 10, 2009, at Angel Salazar General Memorial Hospital. This makes me 16 years old, and as I’ve grown, I’ve learned so much—not just about the world around me, but about who I am, what I love, and the things that make me feel alive.</p>

<p>One of the biggest parts of who I am is my love for performing arts. Dance and performing on stage have always had a special place in my heart. There's something magical about stepping onto the stage, the lights shining down, and feeling the energy of the crowd as you lose yourself in the music and movement. Dance has been a part of me for as long as I can remember. Whether it's expressing myself through choreography or just feeling the rhythm take over, I know my heart belongs to dance.</p>

<p>Alongside dance, I also love singing and playing musical instruments, especially the piano and drums. Music, in all its forms, has always been a big part of my life. It's a way for me to express emotions that words can't always capture. Along with that, I have a passion for writing novels—something I’ve been doing since I was about six years old. Writing allows me to escape into different worlds, create new characters, and dive into the complexities of human emotions. It’s a wonderful way for me to be both imaginative and introspective.</p>

<p>In addition to music and performing, I have a creative side that also spills into painting and learning new things. I’ve always loved exploring new hobbies and skills that expand my perspective and understanding of the world. My creative pursuits give me a sense of joy and fulfillment.</P>

<p>Ever since I was young, I’ve had an unshakeable love for the color purple. Growing up, purple was everywhere in my life—my clothes, my toys, my room—anything I owned had to be purple. If it wasn’t, I’d throw a temper tantrum. It was just this deep, unexplainable connection to the color, and I think it was a reflection of my vibrant personality.</p>

<p>Music plays a huge role in my life, too. I have an eclectic taste—K-pop, musical theater, indie, and pop music are just a few of the genres that resonate with me. Each genre speaks to me in different ways, and I love the variety and emotion that music brings into my life.</p>

<p>My childhood was deeply shaped by my family, particularly my grandparents and aunt, whom I call Mama. My mom went to Malaysia for work when I was young, and my dad moved to Manila, so I grew up mostly in the care of my Mama and Lola (my grandmother). They provided the love and stability I needed, especially during the tough times.</p>

<p>However, my childhood wasn’t without its struggles. I’ve always had a weak immune system, which led to frequent trips to the hospital. I’ve battled illnesses like broncho pneumonia, and when I was only three years old, I was rushed to the hospital after throwing up repeatedly. That experience was traumatic for me, as I had to endure multiple needle injections, which is why I developed a deep fear of doctors and nurses. I also have several health conditions, such as allergy rhinitis, sinusitis, asthma, eczema, poor eyesight, and occasionally, trouble with hearing. These physical challenges have made life more difficult at times, but I’ve always tried to keep a positive outlook, focusing on what I can control and what I love.</p>

<p>Despite these struggles, I’ve never let my health define me. Performing—especially dancing and singing—has always been a way for me to express myself and escape the stresses of life. Every time I step onto the stage or take part in a dance routine, I feel a sense of freedom and joy that I can’t find anywhere else. It’s the one place where I can truly be myself, and it fills me with a sense of accomplishment and pride. I also continue to express my creativity through writing, which has been a consistent passion of mine since I was young. Writing stories allows me to take control of my own narrative and to create worlds where I can be whoever I want to be.</p>

<p>Looking back, I’m grateful for the support I’ve had from my family, especially my Mama and Lola. They’ve always been there for me, even in the hardest of times. Their love and care have been a constant source of strength, and I wouldn’t be the person I am today without them.</p>

<p>As I continue to grow, I am more and more determined to pursue my passions and stay true to who I am. Dance, music, performing, and writing are the things that light up my soul, and I am excited for what the future holds. No matter what challenges I face, I know that my creative outlets will always be my anchor. </p>
