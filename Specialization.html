        <h2>Zail Krizsha Barrientos Samulde</h2>
        <p>I entered SPA in 7th grade as a dance major but i switched majors during 9th grade due to health reasons. I love both writing and dancing. I love showcasing my talent and performing on stage.</p>
<P> I’m in the Special Program in the Arts (SPA), and it’s been such a ride. I started out majoring in dance, and honestly, that was where my heart was. There’s something about the freedom and expression that comes with moving your body to music—it felt like the perfect way for me to tell stories. But, due to some health issues, I had to make the tough decision to switch from dance to creative writing.

At first, it was a bit of an adjustment. Dance had been such a big part of me, and shifting to writing felt like stepping into a new world. But honestly, creative writing has allowed me to continue expressing myself in a different way. Writing is still about storytelling—about conveying emotions, creating worlds, and communicating with others, just like dance used to be for me. I think the discipline and focus I had from dance really helped me when it came to diving into creative writing. It taught me how to commit to something, how to express myself with intensity, and how to stay dedicated to my craft.

School life now is a mix of balancing my academic subjects with my creative projects. My days are filled with writing exercises, workshops, and sometimes intense moments of self-doubt, but there’s always that spark when an idea clicks, or when I finish a piece that feels like it truly expresses what I wanted to say. I get to work with other creative students, which keeps me inspired. Even though I'm no longer dancing, I still find ways to bring movement into my writing, especially in how I describe emotions and scenes.

I’m grateful for my time in dance because it’s shaped the artist I am today, but I’ve also embraced creative writing as a way to continue my artistic journey. It’s been challenging at times, but I think I’ve grown so much as both a person and an artist through it all.</p>
